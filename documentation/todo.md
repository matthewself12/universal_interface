# TODOs/Scheduling

## First Deliverables
- Andres: Start building UART peripheral
- Gilon: Write a complete protocol specification (involving bulk streaming as well?). 
- Adam: Researching bus arbitration, think about how we should prioritize peripherals and reading/writing. Are there common bottlenecks
- Matthew S: Investigating FTDI drivers, cross platform use of D3XX, enumerating our device as multiple virtual USB devices?
- Matthew H: Scaffold HDL for the project. Includes the shared constants, small structural components, and common MUXing/IO/FIFO components
